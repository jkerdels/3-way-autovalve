This table contains the data and subsequent analysis of a series of test measurements to calibrate the flow meter. The flow meter sends out one pulse per given amount of water volume that flows through the flow meter. However, the amount of water per pulse is not constant and depends on the speed with which the water flows through the meter.

To calibrate the flow meter the number of ticks and the accumulated time between ticks were recorded for filling up a bucket up to a 10 liter mark with varying speeds of water flow. Then the average time between two ticks and the amount of water per tick were calculated from these numbers. Plotting time between ticks vs. volume per tick revealed an apparently quadratic relationship. Thus, a quadratic polynomial was fitted to the data using libreoffice's LINEST function. Using the coefficients from that fit the data for a lookup-table that could be used in the arduino program was generated. This lookup-table is indexed by the time in milliseconds between two pulses from the flow meter and returns the amount of water volume in hundreds of milliliters, e.g., a value of 164 means 1.64 ml.

It is recommended to repeat this calibration for each sensor you use and update the lookup-table correspondingly. Be aware that the values of the current table luckily fit into the byte data type. If your calibration results in values that are larger than a byte can hold, remember to adjust the data type in the code from byte to, e.g., unsigned int.
